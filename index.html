									<p>On April 15, 1912, the infamous Titanic Ocean liner on a voyage to New York City struck an iceberg and sank in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. There were an estimated 2,200 passengers and crew on board; about 1,500 people died. The ship was equipped with 20 lifeboats despite the capacity of 48. The catastrophe spurred major changes to maritime safety regulations serving as a reminder of the human cost of negligence at sea.<p>
										The aim of this project was to construct a Logistic Regression Model capable of predicting passenger survival in the Titanic disaster. The dataset offers comprehensive information about passengers, including their demographics, fare, boarding location, family relations, cabin details, ticket numbers, and survival status.<p>
										To tackle the challenge of missing data, particularly in the 'Age' column, a multivariate approach was adopted. Leveraging Scikit-learn's multivariate imputer, a Linear Regression algorithm was employed to estimate missing values by leveraging the entire set of available features. Subsequently, a Logistic Regression algorithm was deployed to predict passenger survival based on the imputed dataset. Through this analytical endeavor, the project seeks to shed light on the factors influencing survival outcomes in one of history's most infamous maritime disasters.

									<p> The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer research programs funded by the National Science Foundation, offering opportunities for undergraduates in STEM fields across various locations in the United States. These programs are designed to provide students with immersive research experiences and valuable insights into graduate education. Participants are matched with specific research projects and collaborate directly with faculty members and fellow researchers at their site.<p>
										Last summer, I had the privilege of joining the Interdisciplinary Data Science Research for Healthy Communities in the Digital Age program, hosted at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. In this program, I worked on a research project under the guidance of Professors Elke Rundensteiner and Shichao Liu, alongside Ph.D. students Ricardo Flores, Avantika Shrestha, Xingtong Guo, and undergraduate researchers Nikola Grozdani and Alexander Pietrick.<p>
										Our project involved analyzing physiological data obtained from Fitbit devices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the creation of multiple machine learning models, we aimed to screen this physiological data alongside depression screening surveys completed by 166 college students. Our most successful model achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.92 when evaluating these physiological modalities. These findings underscore the potential of digital technology advancements in enhancing current clinical practices.<p>
										This research was part of the EMUTIVO project, which focuses on leveraging novel data sources to develop innovative methods for detecting emotions, moods, and mental health states.

									<p>In this project, I dived into sales data from a bakery collected in 2020, using Excel's robust features for in-depth analysis. My aim was to sharpen my Excel skills by working with a manageable dataset. As such the data preprocessing and visualizations were all done through Excel.<p>
										First things first, I cleaned up the data to ensure consistency, removing any duplicates or irrelevant entries. Then, I tapped into a range of Excel functions to extract insights. For instance, I used the IF function to flag items selling below a set threshold, providing valuable feedback on sales performance. The SUM function was my go-to for tallying up total sales and revenue for each bakery item. Meanwhile, the MAXIF function helped pinpoint the highest quantity sold for specific items.<p>
										To identify peak sales days, I turned to the XLOOKUP function, which streamlined the process, especially useful for larger datasets. Additionally, the SUMIFS function made it easy to calculate total quantity and revenue for each day.<p>
										After crunching the numbers, I visualized the data using tables and charts to present the results clearly. Through this project, I not only polished my Excel skills but also gained deeper insight into working with sales data.

										<h2><a href="#">Fortune Teller  <br />

									<a href="https://github.com/america-m/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/9a0c7b561b2deaa470cf822c03a40ce7c67ffb8f/Python/Fortune%20Teller" class="image fit"><img src="images/7712063-paper-fortune-teller-close-up.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="400"/></a>
									<p>This project was a fun way to practice commonly used Python techniques while at the same time, bringing back the nostalgic charm of the childhood paper fortune-telling game. Inspired by the classic origami game, it offers a dynamic twist using Python's versatility.<p>

										Here's how it works: the game unfolds with the user's selection of one out of four colors presented. Subsequently, the virtual paper is shuffled, mirroring the chosen color's letter count. Then, another color is chosen, and the paper undergoes a second shuffle based on the total letter count of both colors combined. Finally, the user picks a number, which unveils their fortune.<p>
										
										Unlike the traditional paper game, where the fortunes are permanently attached to numbers, Python allows us to assign fortunes dynamically. Each time the user makes a choice, the fortunes are shuffled accordingly, ensuring a fresh experience every time. Even if the user chooses the same number repeatedly, the fortune will always be different, adapting to the user's previous choices made. As the position of the fortune is always changing. In essence, this Python fortune teller version adds a playful touch to the game, making it feel like your destiny is truly in the hands of code.

									<p>This Python game was crafted as a practical exercise to hone my Python skills while at the same time offering an engaging gameplay experience. It's based on the classic intransitive hand game commonly played between two individuals. Just like its real-life counterpart: Rock triumphs over Scissors, Scissors defeat Paper, and Paper outwits Rock, this Python version adheres to the same rules. 
										In each round, both the computer and the player make random selections for the first five turns. Subsequently, the computer analyzes these initial choices and identifies the most frequently selected option by the player. Armed with this insight, it strategically decides its subsequent moves to maximize competitiveness, ensuring an engaging experience for the player. <p>

									After each round, the player is prompted to decide whether to continue playing. If they opt to continue, the game seamlessly loops back to the beginning, ready for another round. Upon choosing to exit the game, a comprehensive summary is displayed, showcasing total rounds played, victories achieved by both the computer and the player, tied rounds, and a detailed history of player and computer choices throughout the game. This meticulous attention to detail enhances the overall gaming experience, making it both enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. </p>
